        This College Comparison tool helps you compare the top colleges of **Delhi University** based on the following parameters:\n
        - **General Perception** (15%)  
        - **Placements** (25%)  
        - **Infrastructure** (20%)   
        - **Graduate Outcome** (25%)  
        - **Student Satisfaction** (15%)
                
        #### Comparison Flow
        1. **Overall Score Comparison:**
        The primary comparison is based on the Overall Score. If one college has a higher Overall Score, it is considered better.
        
        2. **Level of Preference:**
        If the Overall Scores are the same, the Level of Preference is compared. The college with the higher Level of Preference is considered better.
        
        3. **Preference Indexing:**
        If both the Overall Score and Level of Preference are the same, the Preference Indexing is compared. The college with the higher Preference Indexing is considered better.
